**The project has not still completed, please visit after one month again.**

**Multi-Speaker audio translation**: This Python project provides functionality for real-time multi speakers audio translation using two different methods. It utilizes speech recognition, translation, and text-to-speech libraries to enable translation between different languages. This code works on python 3.10, We have not tested it on other versions. Some older versions will have issues.

**Features** : 
Diarization and Cloning.
